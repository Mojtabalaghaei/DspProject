# Digital Signal Processing Project
This repository includes all the materials gathered during one semester of the course regarding the project.
This is Mojtaba Laghaei, first year graduate student of biomedical engineering at Azad university, South Tehran branch.

This project discusses one of the most well-known topics in digital signal processing field, voice conversion.
Voice conversion is a technique which maps a voice from a source to a destination. The main paper which was thorougly studied and explained in the videos is on a voice conversion method named CYCLEGAN-VC2. You can read after this project more in [this](https://github.com/jackaduma/CycleGAN-VC2) repository.

This repository is being divided into several separate folders regarding each week's activity. In every folder comes the result of its related week. There is something to note about those weeks which were supposed to include videos; according to Github's terms, users are not allowed to upload videos sized more than 10 MB. Therefore, videos are uploaded on google drive where you can find it right [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7J7pv7L3HcMUdrtc-Py2aPJ1GDdGEKh?usp=sharing).

The innovations are yet to be done in a close future. Within the available amount of time we had, we only managed to study the code and explain its innovations. Plus, some of the output samples are also brought in its corresponding directory.
